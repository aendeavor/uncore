## IDEs

The main IDE used for development is [_Visual Studio Code_][visual_studio_code::main] for light tasks as well as working on the documentation and [CLion][clion::main] for code-intensive tasks. For some tasks, [_NeoVim_][neovim::main] is used too.

## Code Documentation & Testing

TBD.

## Coding Style

### General Styling Guidelines

When writing code, adhere to the style provided in this document and to what is already there, even if this is not your preferred style. When altering Markdown or other descriptive documents, look how it has been written and stay true to these design decisions.

Make sure your IDE uses the provided `.editorconfig`.

### Rust

Rust if formatted with `cargo fmt` (or `rustfmt`). These commands are properly invoked via `just fmt`. The style definition is found in `.rustfmt.toml`. Make sure to adjust your style to the already present style.

### YAML

When writing YAML, code is formatted with [Prettier][prettier]. [_Visual Studio Code_][visual_studio_code] has an extension for this formatter. YAML files in a directory are **sorted** by prepending them a number which indicates priority, much like configuration files / systemd - i.e. files with lower number will take priority and will be executed first.

### Bash

#### Overview

Almost all scripts are located under `#!bash scripts/`. Use Bash as the interpreter, i.e. `bash` and not `sh`, `ksh`, `zsh` or any other interpreter. Therefore, dependent on the context, the shebang is either `#!/bin/bash` or `#!/usr/bin/env bash`. It's **mandatory** to use Bash in version 5 and above. We use `shellcheck` in version `v0.7.1` to test scripts. This is done during CI/CD too to enforce the use of this tool. Make sure to use `just shellcheck` to check for errors are styling guides.

#### Initial Description

When writing a script, the first part of scripts is uniform. The following snippet is taken from the `#!bash init.sh` script. **Always** provide version, executor or sourcing script as well as the task. Afterwards, imports are handled. Thereafter, `#!bash set`'s are executed followed by the definition of the `#!bash SCRIPT` variable, a variable every script has (which enabled logging functionality). 

``` BASH hl_lines="4 5 6"
#! /bin/bash

: '
# ? version       v0.1.0 RC1 ALPHA1 UNSTABLE
# ? executed by   just
# ? task          handles init jobs
'

# shellcheck source=./lib/errors.sh
. scripts/lib/errors.sh
# shellcheck source=./lib/logs.sh
. scripts/lib/logs.sh

SCRIPT='INIT'

# -->                   -->                   --> START
```

#### If Else Statements

``` BASH
# the default if-else-style using double-braces
# remember you do not need "" when using [[ ]]
if [[ <CONDITION> ]] && [[ -f $FILE ]]
then
  <CODE TO RUN>
# when using a command, omit the braces
# when comparing numbers, use -eq/-ne/-lt/-ge, not != or ==
elif ! <COMMAND> || [[ $VAR -ne <NUMBER> ]]
then
  <CODE TO TUN>
fi
```

#### Variables & Braces

Variables are always uppercase and consist of only alphanumeric symbols. Do not precede a variable an underline. We always use braces. If you forgot this and want to change it later, you can use [this link](https://regex101.com/r/ikzJpF/4), which points to <https://regex101.com>. The used regex is `\$([^{("\\'\/])([a-zA-Z0-9_]*)([^}\/ \t'"\n.\]:]*)`, where you should in practice be able to replace all variable occurrences without braces with occurrences with braces.

``` BASH
# good
local VAR="good"
local NEW_VAR="${VAR}"

# bad
var="bad"
```

#### Loops & Switch Statements

Like `#!bash if else`, loops look like this

``` BASH
for / while <LOOP CONDITION>
do
  <CODE TO RUN>
done
```

Make sure to be aware of the `#!bash while read -r VAR; do ...; done < <(INPUT)` construction. This is idiomatic Bash and mandatory.

``` BASH

# an overengineered solution to allow shellcheck -x to
# properly follow `source=<SOURCE FILE>` when sourcing
# files with `. <FILE>` in shell scripts.
while read -r FILE
do
  if ! (
    cd "$(realpath "$(dirname "$(readlink -f "${FILE}")")")"
    "${LINT[@]}" "$(basename -- "${FILE}")")
  then
    ERR=1
  fi
done < <(find . -type f -iname "*.sh")
```

For `#!bash case ${VAR} in` statements

``` BASH
case ${VAR} in
  'case1' ) __on_the_same_line ;;
  'case2' ) __stay_frosty      ;;
  'case3' )
    __now_there_is_more_to_do
    printf 'Multi lines are done this way'
    ;;
  
  'case 4' )
    __now_there_is_even_more_to_do
    printf "That's the way it is"
    ;;

esac
```

#### Functions

When using functions, they are used this way. Please use `#!bash function _main` to start the script as this provides a clear starting point.

``` BASH
function _<name_underscored_and_lowercase>
{
  <CODE TO RUN>

  # variables that can be local should be local
  local <LOCAL_VARIABLE_NAME>
}
```

#### Error Tracing

A construct to trace error in your scripts looks like this. Remember: Remove `#!bash set -x` in the end - this is for debugging purposes only.

``` BASH
set -euxEo pipefail
trap '__log_err ${FUNCNAME[0]:-"?"} ${_:-"?"} ${LINENO:-"?"} ${?:-"?"}' ERR

function __log_err
{
  local FUNC_NAME LINE EXIT_CODE
  FUNC_NAME="${1} / ${2}"
  LINE="${3}"
  EXIT_CODE="${4}"

  printf "\nâ€“â€“â€“ \e[1m\e[31mUNCHECKED ERROR\e[0m\n%s\n%s\n%s\n%s\n\n" \
    "  â€“ script    = ${SCRIPT,,}.sh" \
    "  â€“ function  = ${FUNC_NAME}" \
    "  â€“ line      = ${LINE}" \
    "  â€“ exit code = ${EXIT_CODE}"

  <CODE TO RUN AFTERWARDS>
}
```

#### Arrays

Do not create arrays with non-robust methods. Use `#!bash read` or `#!bash mapfile`.

``` BASH
declare -a ARRAY
IFS='DELIMITER' ; read -r -a ARRAY < <(COMMAND INPUT)
unset IFS
```

#### Comments and Descriptiveness

Comments should be kept minimal and only describe non-obvious matters, i.e. not what the code does. Comments should start lowercase as most of them are not sentences. Make the code **self-descriptive** by using meaningful names! Make comments not longer than 75 columns, then wrap the line.
